 <h1>Getting started with your new BeagleBone</h1>
 <p>This is the quick-start guide.  Please read the
  <a href="Docs/Hardware/BONE_SRM.pdf">BeagleBone System Reference Manual</a>
  and view the
  <a href="http://beagleboard.org/beagleboard101">BeagleBoard101 presentation</a>
  before looking for any additional help.  It is also highly recommended
  for you to read the <a href="http://beagleboard.org/support/faq">Frequently
  Asked Questions guide</a>.
 </p>

 <h2>Before you begin, update to the newest demo image</h2>
 <p>The latest version of this Angstrom Cloud9 IDE demo image is available from
  <a href="http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/demo/beaglebone">the Angstrom
  Distribution BeagleBone demo page</a>.  Please visit there now to download
  the latest version.  The <a href="http://beagleboard.org/beagleboard101">
  BeagleBoard101 presentation</a> will walk you through the process
  of writing the demo image to a microSD card if you aren't already a Linux
  user.
 </p>
 <p>If you are using a different microSD card image, please look for support
  from the supplier of that image.
 </p>

 <h2>Some software already running on your BeagleBone</h2>
 <p>The Angstrom Distribution image provided with your BeagleBone includes a
  large amount of software already running as you are reading this document.
  It is also possible to install many more pre-built packages from the on-line
  repository feed using the 'opkg' tool.
 </p>
 <p>Some of the running programs include web servers and other Internet servers
  that give you access to the board, even if you don't have a display, mouse
  and keyboard connected to it.
 </p>
 <p>Here is a list of some of the running servers:
  <ul>
   <li>ssh (port 22) - </li>
   <li>boneserver (port 80) - </li>
   <li>GateOne (port 443) - </li>
   <li>Cloud9 IDE (port 3000) - </li>
  </ul>
 </p>

 <h2>Decision time: Ethernet or single-cable USB based development?</h2>
 <p>The most recommended path from here for someone experienced in managing their
  local network and performing remote logins via ssh is to go get a
  <a href="http://beagleboard.org/peripheral#5V">recommended 5V power adapter</a>
  and connect your BeagleBone via an Ethernet to your LAN.  Your BeagleBone will
  automatically start web services to which you can connect, so you can avoid
  installing USB drivers until you want to perform some lower-level debug.  Use
  Bonjour or your router's DHCP log to discover the IP address of your board and
  browse to it.
 </p>
 <p>Further, right now, the clock speed of the BeagleBone is determined by
  if the power source is USB or the 5V adapter at initial boot.  It will be
  500MHz if the power source is USB and 720MHz if the power source is an adapter.
 </p>
 <p>If you don't understand what I just said, please continue...
 </p>

 <h2>Getting your host machine drivers setup</h2>
 <p>This BeagleBone demo images exposes five (5) different USB device types to
  your host machine:
  <ol>
   <li>SMSC USB hub</li>
   <li>Linux mass storage class interface</li>
   <li>FTDI USB-to-serial interface</li>
   <li>FTDI USB-to-JTAG interface</li>
   <li>Linux USB-to-Ethernet interface</li>
  </ol>
 </p>
 <p>Neither of the SMSC USB hub and Linux mass storage class interface will
  require any driver installation on your host machine as drivers for those
  are completely standard in all major operating systems.
  Your BeagleBone comes with a built-in USB-to-serial interface adapter.  To
  enable it, you'll need to install the Windows, Mac OSX or Linux driver.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Windows:
   <ul>
    <li>Code Composer Studio v5 (CCSv5) is a TI provided Eclipse-based integrated
     development environment that enables you to debug and develop C/C++ applications
     for your BeagleBone.  If you've already installed CCSv5, you already have the
     driver and you can skip this step.  CCSv5 can be used with the BeagleBone for
     free.  See
     <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Category:Code_Composer_Studio_v5">
     the CCSv5 wiki page</a> for download and installation information.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, point your Windows machine to the <a href="Drivers/Windows/FTDI">
     \Drivers\Windows\FTDI</a> folder for the drivers.  If you closed the window, 
     double-click each of the .inf files to manually install the drivers.</li>
    <li>Start Hyperterminal and point it to the newest COM port.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mac OS X:
   <ul>
    <li>Open
     <a href="Drivers/MacOSX/FTDI/FTDI_Ser.dmg">/Drivers/MacOSX/FTDI/FTDI_Ser.dmg</a>,
     double-click "FTDI_Serial.pkg" and follow the instructions.  For additional
     information, visit
     <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">ftdichip.com</a>.
    </li>
    <li>To open the serial terminal from within Terminal.app, use the following command:
     <pre>screen /dev/tty.usb*B 115200</pre>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Linux:
   <ul>
    <li>For a quick start, simply use the following commands:
     <pre>
sudo modprobe ftdi_sio vendor=0x0403 product=0xa6d0
screen /dev/`dmesg  | grep FTDI | grep "now attached to" | tail -n 1 | awk '{ print $NF }'` 115200
     </pre>
    </li>
    <li>To make the BeagleBone show up upon every reboot, add a udev rule.  Here is an example
     /etc/udev/rules.d/73-beaglebone.rules:
     <pre>
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_interface", \
        ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="a6d0", \
        DRIVER=="", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe -b ftdi_sio"

ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="drivers", \
        ENV{DEVPATH}=="/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio", \
        ATTR{new_id}="0403 a6d0"

ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", \ ATTRS{interface}=="BeagleBone", \
        ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}=="00", \ SYMLINK+="beaglebone-jtag"

ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", \ ATTRS{interface}=="BeagleBone", \
        ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}=="01", \ SYMLINK+="beaglebone-serial"
     </pre>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Step #2: Install the USB-to-Ethernet device driver</h2>
 <p>The Linux distribution running on your BeagleBone supports emulating a USB-to-Ethernet
  device such that you can access your BeagleBone with networking protocols, such as web
  browsing.
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>Prepare for the driver installation.
   <ul>
    <li>Windows:
     <ul>
      <li>Copy linux.inf from the <a href="Drivers/Windows/RNDIS">
       "\Drivers\Windows\RNDIS"</a> folder to your PC for use to tell Windows where to
       find the driver.</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Mac OS X:
     <ul>
      <li>The folks over at Bug Labs have produced a driver you might use:
       <a href="http://bugcommunity.com/wiki/index.php/Start_Guide_Mac_OS_X_10.5">
        http://bugcommunity.com/wiki/index.php/Start_Guide_Mac_OS_X_10.5
       </a>
      </li>
     </ul>
    <li>Linux:
     <ul><li>No driver installation should be required, simply configure the adapter for DHCP.</li></ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Eject the BEAGLE_BONE USB drive.  The USB Ethernet gadget will automatically start.</li>
  <li>Configure the adapter that appears for DHCP.</li>
 </ol>

 <h2>Step #3: Navigate to your BeagleBone's web interface</h2>
 <p>The Linux distribution running on your BeagleBone is configured to start a handful
  of web servers upon boot.  This is the easiest way to get explore and program your
  BeagleBone if you are not already experienced with Linux.
 </p>
 <p>Please note that many of the tools do not support Internet Explorer.  It is recommended
  you use recent versions of Chrome or Firefox.

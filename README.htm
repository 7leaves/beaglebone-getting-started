 <h2 id="software"><u>Software introduction</u></h2>
 <p>The Angstrom Distribution image provided with your BeagleBone includes a
  large amount of software already running as you are reading this document.
  It is also possible to install many more pre-built packages from the on-line
  repository feed using the 'opkg' tool.
 </p>
 <p>Some of the running programs include web servers and other Internet servers
  that give you access to the board, even if you don't have a display, mouse
  and keyboard connected to it.
 </p>

 <h3 id="decision"><u>Network connectivity</u></h3>
 <p>For many people, connecting your BeagleBone to your LAN and powering it via
  a <a href="http://beagleboard.org/peripheral#5V">recommended 5V power
  adapter</a> is sufficient to get started using the BeagleBone.  The BeagleBone
  will fetch an IP address using DHCP and will broadcast it services using <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_(software)">Avahi</a>, so it is
  likely you'll simply see <a
  href="http://beaglebone.local">beaglebone.local</a> on your network.  If the
  DHCP address was provided ahead of you connecting up your USB cable, you
  might also find the IP address in <a href="info.txt">info.txt</a>.  Another
  option is to use your router's DHCP log to discover the IP address of your
  board.
 </p>
 <p><small><b>Note:</b> The clock speed of the BeagleBone is determined by if
  the power source is USB or the 5V adapter at initial boot.  It will be 500MHz
  if the power source is USB and 720MHz if the power source is an
  adapter.</small>
 </p>

 <h3 id="drivers"><u>Getting your host machine USB drivers setup</u></h3>
 <p>This BeagleBone demo image exposes multiple USB device types to
  your host machine:
  <ul class="arrow">
   <li>FTDI USB-to-JTAG interface</li>
   <li>FTDI USB-to-serial interface</li>
   <li>Linux mass storage class interface <b>(<i>on startup</i>)</b><br/></li>
   <li>Linux USB-to-Ethernet interface <b>(<i>following &ltEJECT&gt</i>)</b></li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p><small><b>Note:</b> On revision A3/A4 boards, the VID/PID were chosen to
  match the TI XDS100v2 (0x0403/0xA6D0).  On A5 and newer revisions when we've
  given the authors of CCS the chance to update their software, the generic
  FTDI VID/PID (0x0403/0x6010) will be used to simplify installation of drivers
  for systems already having those drivers.</small>
 </p>
 <p><small><b>Note:</b> OpenOCD is an application that provides JTAG-based
  debugging on all three operating systems, but support for the BeagleBone
  USB-to-JTAG interface is still a work in progress.  Please visit the <a
  href="http://openocd.sourceforge.net/">OpenOCD Homepage</a> to learn more
  about the project, join the mailing list and help us to add support for the
  BeagleBone.</small>
 </p>
 <p>Otherwise, support varies across Windows, Mac OSX or Linux.
 </p>

 <h4>Windows</h4>
 <ul class="arrow">
  <li>Code Composer Studio v5 (CCSv5) is a TI provided Eclipse-based integrated
   development environment that enables you to debug and develop C/C++ applications
   for your BeagleBone.  CCSv5 provides both a USB-to-serial driver as well as
   support for the USB-to-JTAG interface.  See the
   <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Category:Code_Composer_Studio_v5">
   CCSv5 wiki</a> page for download and installation information and
   <a href="Docs/ccs-jtag-simple.htm">instructions on getting started</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Save and execute <a href="Drivers/Windows/BONE_DRV.exe">
   BONE_DRV.exe</a> for the USB-to-serial and USB-to-Ethernet drivers (or
   <a href="Drivers/Windows/BONE_D64.exe">BONE_D64.exe</a> for 64-bit Windows).
   For additional information, visit
   <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">FTDI's Virtual COM Port Drivers</a>
   page and the Ethernet over USB section of the <a href="http://www.linux-usb.org/gadget/">
   Linux-USB Gadget API Framework</a> page.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
 <ul class="arrow">
  <li>Save and open
   <a href="Drivers/MacOSX/FTDI/FTDI_Ser.dmg">FTDI_Ser.dmg</a>,
   choose the correct .mpkg file and install the USB-to-serial drivers.
   For additional information, visit
   <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">FTDI's Virtual COM Port Drivers</a>
   page.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p><small><b>Note:</b> For the USB-to-Ethernet interface, the drivers are
  likely <i>already built into your system</i>, so no additional work is
  required.  For older OS X systems, you can look at the driver the folks over
  at Bug Labs have produced for their excellent modular development platform
  that you might use: <a
  href="http://bugcommunity.com/wiki/index.php/Start_Guide_Mac_OS_X_10.5">

  allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>
 <p><small><b>Note:</b> The above uses an older software revision, but the
  differences are minimal.</small>
 </p>

 <h4>Linux</h4>
 <p>For A5 boards, no drivers should need to be installed.  For older boards,
  you'll need invoke the driver by specifying the vendor and product ID:
 </p>
 <pre>
sudo modprobe ftdi_sio vendor=0x0403 product=0xa6d0
 </pre>
 <p>To make a pre-A5 BeagleBone show up upon every reboot, add a udev rule.
  Here is an example /etc/udev/rules.d/73-beaglebone.rules:
  <pre>
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_interface", \
        ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="a6d0", \
        DRIVER=="", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe -b ftdi_sio"

ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="drivers", \
        ENV{DEVPATH}=="/bus/usb-serial/drivers/ftdi_sio", \
        ATTR{new_id}="0403 a6d0"

ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", \
	ATTRS{interface}=="BeagleBone", \
        ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}=="00", \
	SYMLINK+="beaglebone-jtag"

ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", \
	ATTRS{interface}=="BeagleBone", \
        ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}=="01", \
	SYMLINK+="beaglebone-serial"
  </pre>
  Run the following to load the new udev rules:
  <pre>
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
  </pre>
 </p>
 <p><small><b>Note:</b> Code Composer Studio v5 (CCSv5) is a TI provided
  Eclipse-based integrated development environment that enables you to debug
  and develop C/C++ applications for your BeagleBone.  CCSv5 provides debug
  support in Linux over the USB-to-JTAG interface.  See the <a
  href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Category:Code_Composer_Studio_v5">
  CCSv5 wiki</a> page for download and installation information.</small>
 </p>

 <h3 id="serial"><u>Connect to your BeagleBone's serial console</u></h3>
 <p>Connecing to the serial port will give you access to the bootloader shell,
  kernel boot logs, a login prompt and the Linux shell.  The username is 'root'
  and the password is not set.  If the board is already booted, a quick press
  of &lt;Enter&gt; should bring up a new login prompt.
 </p>

 <h4>Windows</h4>
 <ul class="arrow">
  <li>Launch HyperTerminal (Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Communications
   -> HyperTerminal)</li>
  <li>Give the name 'BeagleBone' and press &lt;Enter&gt;</li>
  <li>Select the last (newest) COM port and press &lt;Enter&gt;</li>
  <li>Choose '115200' Bits per second, '8' Data bits, 'None' Parity, '1' Stop
   Bits, 'None' Flow control and press &lt;Enter&gt;
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h4>Mac OS X or Linux</h4>
 <p>To open the serial terminal from a shell prompt, use the following command:
  <pre>
screen `ls /dev/{tty.usb*B,beaglebone-serial}` 115200
  </pre>
  Type CTRL-a k to exit screen.
 </p>

 <h3 id="g_ether"><u>Launch USB-to-Ethernet interface</u></h3>
 <p><b>Eject the "BEAGLE_BONE" drive to enable the USB-to-Ethernet interface.</b></p>
 <p>At boot-up, the processor on your BeagleBone is running a USB storage "gadget" driver
  that served you up this file.  For this software build, you need to swap the storage gadget
  for a USB-to-Ethernet gadget when you are ready to establish an IP connection over your
  USB cable.
 </p>
 <ul class="arrow">
  <li>From your PC, eject the BEAGLE_BONE USB drive.  The USB Ethernet gadget will automatically start.<br />
   <br /><small><b>Note #1:</b> It has been observed in Windows that it may actually take a
   couple of minutes for the driver to load on occasion.</small><br />
   <br /><small><b>Note #2:</b> It has been observed in Windows that you may be prompted
   to locate the 'linux.inf' file.  If you installed the driver properly, you should be able to
   find it under c:\windows\system32\drvstore\linux_...</small><br />
   <br />
  </li>
  <li>Configure the adapter that appears for DHCP.</li>
  <li>The adapter should be given the IP address 192.168.7.1.<li>
 </ul>

 <h3 id="navigate"><u>Navigate to your BeagleBone's web interface</u></h3>
 <p>At this point, you should have an IP connection either over Ethernet or over your
  USB cable.  The links below assume you are using your USB cable, which should be
  providing fixed IP addresses.</p>
 <p>The Linux distribution running on your BeagleBone is configured to start a handful
  of web servers upon boot.  This is the easiest way to get explore and program your
  BeagleBone if you are not already experienced with Linux.
 </p>
 <p><small><b>Note:</b> Please note that many of the tools do not support Internet
  Explorer.  It is recommended you use recent versions of Chrome or Firefox.
 </small></p>
 <p><small><b>Note #2:</b> Some VPNs may interfere with your local network connection to
    your BeagleBone.  Please consult your VPN guide.</small>

 <h3 id="revisions"><u>History of the hardware revisions</u></h3>
 <h4>A3</h4> <p>This is the original version of the board. Main issue was
 issues with the reset switch where the reset line was being pulled low which
 could cause random dropping of the Ethernet port. This issue has not be seen
 broadly.</p>
  
 <h4>A4</h4> <p>This version of the board was mainly to provide a new SD
 connector due to supply issues. Also added was R219 in an attempt to make the
 Yellow LED on the RJ45 turn on when at 100M operation. This caused the
 Ethernet not to work on power up but did work after a board reboot.</p>
   
 <h4>A5</h4> <p>This version of the board returns the functionality of the
 board to that of the Rev A3 via the removal of R219. There have been no PCB
 changes for this revision. It uses the same PCB revision as the A4. It also
 ships with an updated version of the Angstrom image providing out of the box
 support for the DVI-D and 7” LCD Capes.</p>
    
 <p>There will be three possible versions of the Rev A5. One will be the new
 production version that is built from the ground up as an A5. The second
 version will be a reworked Revision A4 that has R219 removed at the factory
 and retested. The third version will be a revision A3, that just has the
 updated SW added. All reworked versions will have the reset switches double
 checked as well. All reworked boards will be retested using the full
 production test process.</p>
     
 <p>You will be able to identify these versions via the serial number. They
 all will be labeled as revision A5. The two digits after the BB in the serial
 number, S/N: 5111BB<font color="red">00</font>0023, will indicate the board.
 A fresh revision A5, will be 00, A4 reworked will be 01, and a recertified A3
 will be 02. There is no functional or operational difference between any of
 these boards. They are all revision A5 and will ship with the same SW.</p>
      
 <p>For those with Revision A3 and A4, you will be able to download the latest
 shipping image from <a
 href="http://circuitco.com/support/index.php?title=BeagleBone">CircuitCo.com's
 BeagleBone page</a> and have all the features of the Revision A5. For A4
 users, you will need to remove R219 and instructions are provided also at <a

 BeagleBone page</a>.</p>
